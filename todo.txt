3 M build, static path: don't copy gfx folder to bundle/*, just use it straight away, make sure it's zipped (font should still be copied to bundled as it's referenced in css; graphics in CSS should be embedded in future)
3 M background picture: computed property that uses ThemeModel.small and ThemeModel.backgroundVisible (default false) to determine background visibility, Theme.setBackgroundVisibility settings; decorate load_config and (with .off) when config is loaded in data.js theme.setBackgroundVisibility is updated (in settings.js, temporarily)
