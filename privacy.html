<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>Piotr Jamr√≥z built the 'afterwriting app as an Open Source application and provides it at no cost under MIT
    license.</p>
<p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal
    Information if anyone decided to use the application.</p>

<h1>Information Collection and Use</strong></h1>
<div>
    <p>
        The site does not collect any personal information. It is a simple HTML/JS application without any database
        or backend services. You can simply open it your browser and turn the internet connection off - it'll still work
        (apart from 3rd party services - Google Drive and Dropbox). <strong>What happens on your computer stays on your
        computer.</strong>
    </p>


    <p>The application does use some third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
    <p>Link to privacy policy of third party service providers used by the app</p>
